                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <h3><u>Semester 1: Fall 2015</u></h3>
                    <p><span class="drop">A</span>s discussed in the <a href="about.html">About Page</a> and the <a href="16/conclusion.html">Conclusion Page</a>, 
                        our team's mission was to create a new, user friendly webpage that described how Dickinson may have wanted different variations of words, or even total lines, within the eleven poems of Fascicle 16.  (To view the original website by Michele Ierardi, <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~ajf2j/emily/stab.html">click here</a>. To see Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar's rendition of the website, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/EmilyDickinson16/1601.html">click here</a>.)
                    However, while analyzing these variations, our team decided to dig a little deeper into Dickinson's poems of Fascicle 16 as opposed to the different published versions of the poems.  
                    In order to do this and analyze this new data, our team had to go through many different processes and obstacles to produce what you are seeing today.  Below is a breakdown of everything our team has had to do 
                    in the past semester.</p>
                    <p>To begin the process to a better website, <a href="hmembers.html">Brooke Stewart</a> and <a href="members.html">Nicole</a> had to go back through the original scans of Dickinson's Fascicle 16 and re-transcribe them.  After we did this, we compared them to the code that was already marking 
                        up all of the poems.  (You can see the original markup <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/tree/master/Old%20Files/TEI-XML">here</a>.)  After fixing the transcription errors and the markup, our team decided it would be interesting to compare the 
                        original Dickinson Fascicle 16 poems to the various published versions of the poems.  However, this required a new and difficult markup.  First, we had to find a way to distinguish which poem line, word, or punctuation variations belonged to which published version of the 
                        poems.  To do this, Brooke Stewart and <a href="members.html">Brooke Lawrence</a> got to work on creating new witness attributes within the reading elements to define the different publications (#fh for Final Harvest, etc.).  Nicole created a list of witnesses in the top parts of the XML documents so we could reference the witness attributes.  
                        To see the new markup we created, <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/tree/master/Dickinson">click here</a>.</p>
                    <p>As the Brooke's and Nicole got the markup finished for the poems, <a href="members.html">Alex</a> was working to create an XSLT to turn the XML versions of the poems into HTML versions that are readable online.  You can see his XSLT <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/DickinsonLineNumbers/dickinson.xsl">here</a>.  
                    Alex was also working on a way that would help the viewers see the differences in the variations within the original Dickinson poems themselves as well as in the various published versions.  He did this by creating color coordinating buttons, which, when clicked, would show and highlight the different variations within the 
                    poems.  He did this by using a <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/css/styles.css">CSS stylesheet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/scripts/dickinson.js">Javascript</a>.</p>
                    <p>Next, our team definitely wanted the viewers to be able to see the original, scanned images of all of the poems, the Dickinson originals and the published versions, but we were unsure how we wanted to set this up.  Dr. Beshero-Bondar recommended that we try out a new concept for our team: image mapping.  
                    What image mapping would do to the images would be to highlight the differences in variants and create a mouse-over effect where the original Dickinson line would appear.  There were many steps to complete in order for this part of the project to come together, such as photoshopping the images, uploading these photoshopped 
                    images into an <a href="http://imagemap-generator.dariodomi.de/">online generator</a> that would allow us to create the code for the image maps, and then modifying the code to present the information that we wanted to show on the mouse-over.  First, Nicole went through and made copies of all the images, so we could have the original image as well 
                        as a photoshopped copy, which shows the variants within a colored box that was coordinated with the color used for the highlighting of the variants.  You can see all of the images that we created and used for this project <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/tree/master/Web%20Files/img">here</a>.  Alex photoshopped the images that 
                        were originally two pages long into one image and Nicole helped by photoshopping the colored boxes around the variants.  Next, Alex put all of the images into the image map generator to output the code we needed in the HTML documents.  Nicole then input the text we wanted to show on the mouse-over into the alternative attributes and the title attributes.  You can see 
                        our discussion about image mapping <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/issues/14">here</a> and an example of our final HTML documents with the image mapping code <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/Web%20Files/1601.html">here</a> (scroll to the bottom of the document).</p>
                    <p>After we got most of the hard work finished, it was time to decide what kind of data we wanted to analyze within all of the different versions of the poems.  Originally, we only wanted to analyze why Dickinson may have wanted different words or lines in her poems and how this would create a different meaning within the entire poem.  However, after finishing 
                        all of our previous work, we decided to analyze how Dickinson used dashes in her original poems compared to whether the published poems kept these dashes, took them out, or replaced them with another type of punctuation.  With the help of Dr. Beshero-Bondar, Nicole and Brooke Stewart created an <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/blob/master/SVG_Files/xslt_to_SVG-Final.xsl">SVG graph using an XSLT</a> to run over the collection of our XML poems that looks at the dash reduction of the published poems compared to Dickinson's originals.  This, though, took a lot of 
                    thought and searching for how to find a dash regex character in the poems.  We decided to use the analyze-string function in doing this.  You can see our brainstorming <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/EmilyDickinson16/issues/28">here</a>.  After finally figuring out how to calculate our percentages, we finally output an SVG graph that you can find <a href="16/dash.html">here</a> with Brooke Stewart's dash analysis.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, Brooke Lawrence was busy typing up our Home, About, and <a href="16/conclusion.html">Conclusion</a> pages, which as you can see, was a lot of work in and of itself.  After all of the hard work our team put into this project, we hope it helps you understand the poems of Emily Dickinson's Fascicle 16 better.  If you have any questions or concerns 
                        regarding our analysis or methodology, you can do so by contacting us <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
                    <h3><u>Semester 2: Spring 2016</u></h3>
                    <p><span class="drop">A</span>s mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About Page</a>, the Dickinson team for the Spring semester of 2016 (Brooke Stewart and Nicole Lottig) decided to expand the site to include another one of Emily Dickinson's fascicles, Fascicle 6. We decided on Fascicle 6 because it was less about death and contained more poems than Fascicle 16 did, and we wanted a challenge. Taking on this new fascicle meant starting from scratch: transcribing and perfecting new text encoding in the TEI standard. We had many obstacles to overcome when creating the Fascicle 6 part of the Emily Dickinson website that we will describe in detail below.</p>
                    <p>To start our work on Dickinson's Fascicle 6, we had to first locate the a list of the poems that were in the fascicle. To do this, we used <a href="http://inamidst.com/dickinson/fascicles">this website</a>. After figuring out which poems we needed, we headed to the <a href="http://www.edickinson.org/">Emily Dickinson Archive</a>. In order to find the images for each poem, we had to search for the poems by entering in the first line of each one. We then had to head to the library to find all of the previous publications that were used in the Fascicle 16 part of the site and a few more that also contained some of the poems that we could get our hands on from our <a href="http://www.library.pitt.edu/greensburg">Pitt-Greensburg library</a>. You can view all of the sources we used on our <a href="bibliography.html">Bibliography Page</a>. After finding all of the images of the original Dickinson manuscript and scanning in the various published versions of the poems, we began the long process of transcribing and encoding our text in TEI (we did these both at the same time to make things a bit easier and faster). You can view our initial XML text encoding <a href="https://github.com/nlottig94/EmilyDickinson6/tree/master/Dickinson6_InitialXML">here</a>. We also created another <a href="https://github.com/nlottig94/EmilyDickinson6/blob/master/Web-Files/6/xml/Dickinson6_listWit.xml">list of witnesses</a> for this part of the site to have our own reference to go off of before we created our bibliography. We inserted each witness that had a variation of the poem into the top of each poem.</p>
                    <p>After we finished all of our transcriptions and coding, Nicole started to work with the XSLT. We were initially using the XSLT that Alex had made the previous semester</p>
