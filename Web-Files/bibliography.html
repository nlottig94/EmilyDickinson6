                    <h2>Published Versions Bibliography</h2>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>The Poems of Emily Dickinson; Centenary Edition.</i> Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1930. <br/>
                        Edited by Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Alfred Leete Hampson. Martha Dickinson Bianchi was Emily's niece. She and her secretary, Alfred Leete Hampson edited Emily's poems in an attempt to make them more readable. For more information on Martha Dickinson Bianchi, please visit her <a href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/76">biography page</a> on the Emily Dickinson Museum website.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Letter from Emily Dickinson.</i> <a href="http://www.edickinson.org/editions/1/image_sets/240311">Emily Dickinson Archive.</a></p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Letter to Susan Dickinson.</i> <a href="http://www.edickinson.org/editions/1/image_sets/237453">Emily Dickinson Archive.</a><br/>
                        The <i>Centenary Edition</i> feature a different version of poem 11 than the one found in Fascicle 16. We had to locate the origianl manuscript written by Emily Dickinson in a letter to her sister-in-law, Susan Dickinson. We found the first page of the manuscript image on the Emily Dickinson Archive website (linked in this entry). We emailed the editor of the website, who then sent us the missing image of the second page.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Atlantic Monthly.</i> February 1929.<br/>
                        This is an American magazine that published a version of Emily Dickinson's poem 2 in the February issue in 1929.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Bolts of Melody: New Poems of Emily Dickinson.</i> New York: Harper and Brothers, 1945.<br/>
                        Edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and Millicent Todd Bingham. Mabel Loomis Todd was a good friend of Emily and took up publishing her poems in this edition, but did not live to see it completed. Her daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, finished the work on her mother's behalf. For more information on Mabel Loomis Todd, please visit her <a href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/68">biography page</a> on the Emily Dickinson Museum website.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Final Harvest: Emily Dickinson's Poems.</i> Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1961.<br/>
                        Edited by Thomas H. Johnson. As shown in our graph, this edition is the closest representation of Emily's original manuscripts. This edition is the most accurate because literary scholar Thomas H. Johnson returned to Emily's manuscripts, rather than other publisher's editions, to transcribe her peoms as closely as possible before publishing them in print. He studied her handwriting in detail, which allowed for great accuracy. </p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Further Poems of Emily Dickinson.</i> Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1929.<br/>
                        Edited by Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Alfred Leete Hampson.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Poems, Third Series.</i> Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1896.<br/>
                        Edited by Mabel Loomis Todd.</p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Poems, Second Series.</i> Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1891.<br/>
                        Edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson. </p>
                    <p>Dickinson, Emily. <i>Poems.</i> Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1890.<br/>
                        Edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson. Thomas Wentworth Higginson was one of Emily's close friends and mentor. He co-edited this collection of her poems with Mabel Loomis Todd (see <i>Bolts of Melody</i> entry) which was published in 1890, just fours years after Emily's death. The editors changed punctuation and word choices in an attempt to make the poems more readable. For more information on Thomas Wentworth Higginson, please visit his <a href="https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/70">biography page</a> on the Emily Dickinson Museum website.</p>
